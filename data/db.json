At its last event, Huawei spoke about two areas that need considerable work. Let's talk this week about the need for centralized cyberlaw enforcement, and the need for a clear vision on the future of work.

Two of those areas are robotics and artificial intelligence, which we'll see adapted broadly this decade with a considerable bump in 2021.
